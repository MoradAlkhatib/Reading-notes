# Django Models
A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you’re storing. Generally, each model maps to a single database table.

The basics:

Each model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model.
Each attribute of the model represents a database field.
With all of this, Django gives you an automatically-generated database-access API; see Making queries.


example :-
```
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
```

## Using models
Once you have defined your models, you need to tell Django you’re going to use those models.
Do this by editing your settings file and changing the INSTALLED_APPS setting to add the name of the module that contains your models.py.
For example, if the models for your application live in the module myapp.models (the package structure that is created for an application by the manage.
py startapp script), INSTALLED_APPS should read, in part:
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    #...
    'myapp',
    #...
]
```
## Fields
The most important part of a model – and the only required part of a model – is the list of database fields it defines.
Fields are specified by class attributes. Be careful not to choose field names that conflict with the models API like clean, save, or delete.

### Field types
Each field in your model should be an instance of the appropriate Field class. Django uses the field class types to determine a few things:

The column type, which tells the database what kind of data to store (e.g. INTEGER, VARCHAR, TEXT).
The default HTML widget to use when rendering a form field (e.g. <input type="text">, <select>).
The minimal validation requirements, used in Django’s admin and in automatically-generated forms.
  
### Field options
Each field takes a certain set of field-specific arguments (documented in the model field reference). For example, CharField (and its subclasses) require a max_length argument which specifies the size of the VARCHAR database field used to store the data.
There’s also a set of common arguments available to all field types. All are optional. They’re fully explained in the reference, but here’s a quick summary of the most often-used ones:
null
If True, Django will store empty values as NULL in the database. Default is False.
blank
If True, the field is allowed to be blank. Default is False.
Note that this is different than null. null is purely database-related, whereas blank is validation-related. If a field has blank=True, form validation will allow entry of an empty value. If a field has blank=False, the field will be required.
  
## Model inheritance
Model inheritance in Django works almost identically to the way normal class inheritance works in Python, but the basics at the beginning of the page should still be followed. That means the base class should subclass django.db.models.Model.
The only decision you have to make is whether you want the parent models to be models in their own right (with their own database tables), or if the parents are just holders of common information that will only be visible through the child models.

There are three styles of inheritance that are possible in Django.

Often, you will just want to use the parent class to hold information that you don’t want to have to type out for each child model. This class isn’t going to ever be used in isolation, so Abstract base classes are what you’re after.
If you’re subclassing an existing model (perhaps something from another application entirely) and want each model to have its own database table, Multi-table inheritance is the way to go.
Finally, if you only want to modify the Python-level behavior of a model, without changing the models fields in any way, you can use Proxy models.
  
## Proxy models
When using multi-table inheritance, a new database table is created for each subclass of a model. This is usually the desired behavior, since the subclass needs a place to store any additional data fields that are not present on the base class. Sometimes, however, you only want to change the Python behavior of a model – perhaps to change the default manager, or add a new method.

This is what proxy model inheritance is for: creating a proxy for the original model. You can create,
  delete and update instances of the proxy model and all the data will be saved as if you were using the original
  (non-proxied) model. The difference is that you can change things like the default model ordering or the default manager in the proxy, without having to alter the original.
  
  
# The Django admin site
One of the most powerful parts of Django is the automatic admin interface. It reads metadata from your models to provide a quick, model-centric interface where trusted users can manage content on your site. The admin’s recommended use is limited to an organization’s internal management tool. It’s not intended for building your entire front end around.

The admin has many hooks for customization, but beware of trying to use those hooks exclusively. If you need to provide a more process-centric interface that abstracts away the implementation details of database tables and fields, then it’s probably time to write your own views.

In this document we discuss how to activate, use, and customize Django’s admin interface.

## Overview of django admin
The admin is enabled in the default project template used by startproject.

If you’re not using the default project template, here are the requirements:

Add 'django.contrib.admin' and its dependencies - django.contrib.auth, django.contrib.contenttypes, django.contrib.messages, and django.contrib.sessions - to your INSTALLED_APPS setting.

Configure a DjangoTemplates backend in your TEMPLATES setting with django.template.context_processors.request, django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth, and django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages in the 'context_processors' option of OPTIONS.

Changed in Django 3.1:
django.template.context_processors.request was added as a requirement in the 'context_processors' option to support the new AdminSite.enable_nav_sidebar.

If you’ve customized the MIDDLEWARE setting, django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware and django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware must be included.

Hook the admin’s URLs into your URLconf.

After you’ve taken these steps, you’ll be able to use the admin site by visiting the URL you hooked it into (/admin/, by default).

If you need to create a user to login with, use the createsuperuser command. By default, logging in to the admin requires that the user has the is_staff attribute set to True.

Finally, determine which of your application’s models should be editable in the admin interface. For each of those models, register them with the admin as described in ModelAdmin.

Proxy models are declared like normal models. You tell Django that it’s a proxy model by setting the proxy attribute of the Meta class to True.
