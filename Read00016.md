# machine learning
Machine learning is a set of artificial intelligence that relies on focusing on learning from trying and give the predictions from trying.

give a big data for computer on spicific algorithm that allow computer 
to give us  correct predictions throgh of trying and experince without use clear code like a computer software.

## How dose machine learning work?
Data -> algorithm -> modle

## Types of machine learning?
### 1. Supervised learning

Types of supervised learning algorithms
1. Classification 
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Support Vector Machine
Examples:-
Email Spam detection
Speech Recognition
2. Regression
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Ordinary least squarse
- Stepwise Regression
Examples:-
stock price prediction
rainfall prediction
### 2. Unsupervised learning 
Unsupervised learning refers to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify patterns in data sets containing data points
that are neither classified nor labeled. ... In other words, unsupervised learning allows the system to identify patterns within data sets on its own.

### 3. Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general,
a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error.

## The 3 Elements of Great Machine Learning
 
### - A skilled chef (human guidance)
First, even though we are “teaching computers to learn on their own,” human guidance plays a huge role.
As you’ll see, you’ll need to make dozens of decisions along the way.
In fact, the very first major decision is how to road-map your project for guaranteed success.
### - Fresh ingredients (clean, relevant data)
The second essential element is the quality of your data.
Garbage In = Garbage Out, no matter which algorithms you use.
Professional data scientists spend most their time understanding the data, cleaning it, and engineering new features.
While that sounds open-ended, you’ll get our proven frameworks that you can always rely on as starting points.
### - Don’t overcook it (avoid overfitting)
One of the most dangerous pitfalls in machine learning is overfitting. An overfit model has “memorized” the noise in the training set, instead of learning the true underlying patterns.
An overfit model within a hedge fund can cost millions of dollars in losses.
An overfit model within a hospital can costs thousands of lives.
For most applications, the stakes won’t be quite that high, but overfitting is still the single largest mistake you must avoid.


## Why explore your dataset upfront?
You’ll gain valuable hints for Data Cleaning (which can make or break your models).
You’ll think of ideas for Feature Engineering (which can take your models from good to great).
You’ll get a “feel” for the dataset, which will help you communicate results and deliver greater impact.
