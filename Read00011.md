# Jupyter
formally known as the Jupyter Project, is a non-profit organization that creates open-source interactive computing software.
It was founded in 2014 by Colombian physicist and software developer Fernando PÃ©rez, as a language-agnostic version of the IPython (interactive Python) project. Jupyter provides tools for mathematicians,
scientists, students, data analysts, and computing professionals to write code interactively, view real time results, and publish results on the web.

## Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment and Python web server, providing a browser-based UI (user interface) for Jupyter users.
Jupyter Notebooks are an ordered list of input/output cells,
each providing a REPL (read-eval-print loopread-eval-print loop) for writing code and a window to show output in real time.

# NumPy
A data analysis package in python which stands for Numerical Python that provides comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators,
linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms,
and a multidimensional array object, as well as variations such as masks and matrices, which can be used for various math operations .
