# Trees
a collection of nodes, where each node is a data structure consisting of a value and a list of references to nodes.
The start of the tree is the root node and the reference nodes are the children.


## Breadth First Traversal
Traversing a K-ary tree requires a similar approach to the breadth first traversal. We are still pushing nodes into a queue, but we are now moving down a list of children of length k,
instead of checking for the presence of a left and a right child.

## Binary tree
A tree whose elements have at most two children is called a binary tree. Each element in a binary tree can have only two children.
A node’s left child must have a value less than its parent’s value, and the node’s right child must have a value greater than its parent value.

### Searching
While searching for a value in the tree, we need to traverse the node from left to right and with a parent.

## Types of nodes in a tree:

- Parent Node: A node that has one or more children.
- Child Node: A node that has a parent node.
- Leaf Node: A node that doesn’t have any children.
In this article, let’s first see how to implement a tree from scratch without using any library, and later you will see how to implement a tree with the help of a Python library.

### Implement a Tree Using a Python Library
As we have seen, implementing a tree from scratch takes some time and needs a lot of code. An easier way to implement a tree in Python is by using a library called anytree. The anytree library allows you to create a tree without writing a ton of code.

To use the anytree library, we first have to install it with the below command’s help.
```
pip install anytree
```
Here, also we are creating the same tree which we have previously created. Now we can import Node and RenderTree from the anytree library.
```
from anytree import Node, RenderTree

root = Node(10)

level_1_child_1 = Node(34, parent=root)
level_1_child_2 = Node(89, parent=root)
level_2_child_1 = Node(45, parent=level_1_child_1)
level_2_child_2 = Node(50, parent=level_1_child_2)

for pre, fill, node in RenderTree(root):
    print("%s%s" % (pre, node.name))
 ```   
 Tree Structure
          10
        /    \
       34      89
     /    \ 
    45    50 
Output:

10
├── 34
│   └── 45
└── 89
    └── 50
    
   
   
## Big O
The Big O time complexity of a Binary Search Tree’s insertion and search operations is O(h), or O(height).
In the worst case, we will have to search all the way down to a leaf, which will require searching through
as many nodes as the tree is tall. In a balanced (or “perfect”) tree, the height of the tree is log(n). In an unbalanced tree, the worst case height of the tree is n.

The Big O space complexity of a BST search would be O(1). During a search, we are not allocating any additional space.
