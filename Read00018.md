# Cryptography
Cryptography is the art of converting text into another form for secret transmission and reception.
It works by converting plain text into cipher text using some encryption algorithm at the sender’s side and converting ciphertext into plain text at the receiver’s.
Cryptography is used to provide confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation.

## Types of Cryptography
1. Hashing
Hashing is a type of cryptography that changes a message into an unreadable string of text for the purpose of verifying the message’s contents, not hiding the message itself.

2. Symmetric Cryptography
Symmetric Cryptography, likely the most traditional form of cryptography, is also the system with which you are probably most familiar. 
This type of cryptography uses a single key to encrypt a message and then decrypt that message upon delivery.

3. Asymmetric Cryptography
Asymmetric cryptography (as the name suggests) uses two different keys for encryption and decryption, as opposed to the single key used in symmetric cryptography.
The first key is a public key used to encrypt a message, and the second is a private key which is used to decrypt them.
The great part about this system is that only the private key can be used to decrypt encrypted messages sent from a public key.

4. Key Exchange Algorithms
Although this particular type of cryptography isn’t particularly applicable for individuals outside of the cyber-security realm, I wanted to briefly mention to ensure you have a full understanding of the different cryptographic algorithms.

## Encryption, decryption, and cracking
Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).
Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.
Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.

## Caesar cipher: Encode and decode online
Method in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

## Cryptography Crash Course

There are different ways to encrypt (scramble) and decrypt (unscramble) information. They generally fall into two buckets:
Symmetric: encryption and decryption keys are the SAME, uses a private key
Asymmetric: encryption and decryption keys are DIFFERENT, uses a private key (metaphorical key) , and a public key (metaphorical lock), every public key only has one private key


Real-Life Examples You Might Be Not Even Notice

1. HTTPS (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol Secure) is how your local device securely communicates with a web browser or remote site. When you go to an HTTPS-secured server (a secure website that starts with https rather than http), the web browser checks a certificate that lets the browser know that the site is legitimate vs. is a dangerous site that is trying to pose as a different one. HTTPS-secured server prevents information from leaking during the connection. The connection is encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security), not to be confused with its outdated predecessor SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
2. We’re pretty used to signing up for things, logging in, and needing to use a password. The idea that people are really bad at coming up with and remembering passwords has already been around for a while. As it turns out, encryption is a big part of what makes password systems work. In general, most systems will encrypt the password that you type in, and just keep the ciphertext. The next time you log in, it will encrypt whatever you’ve typed in, and then see if that matches with the ciphertext on file. If it doesn’t, you can’t log in. This is why most accounts and sites can only reset the password, but can’t send you your old password.
