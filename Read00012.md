# Pandas
Pandas is a game-changer for data science and analytics, particularly if you came to Python because you were searching for something more powerful than Excel and VBA.
pandas is like Excel in Python: it uses tables (namely DataFrame) and operates transformations on the data. But it can do a lot more.

### The most elementary functions of pandas
Reading data
```
data = pd.read_csv('my_file.csv')
```
Some other great functions: read_clipboard (which I use way too often, copying data from Excel or from the web), read_sql

Writing data
```
data.to_csv('my_new_file.csv', index=None)
```
I usually don’t go for the other functions, like .to_excel, .to_json, .to_pickle since .to_csv does very well the job. And because csv is the most common way to save tables.
There’s also the .to_clipboard if you’re like me an Excel maniac who wants to paste your results from Python to Excel.

Seeing the data
```
data.head(3)
```
Checking the data
```
data.shape
```

#### Object creation 
- Creating a Series by passing a list of values, letting pandas create a default integer index

- Creating a DataFrame by passing a NumPy array, with a datetime index and labeled columns

- Creating a DataFrame by passing a dict of objects that can be converted to series-like.


Overall pandas is one of the reason why Python is such a great language
- simple to use, hiding all the complex and abstract computations behind
- fast, if not the fastest data analysis package (it highly optimized in C)
- (generally) intuitive


#### Grouping 
By “group by” we are referring to a process involving one or more of the following steps:

1. Splitting the data into groups based on some criteria

2. Applying a function to each group independently

3. Combining the results into a data structure

#### What kind of data does pandas handle? 

Import the package, aka import pandas as pd

A table of data is stored as a pandas DataFrame

Each column in a DataFrame is a Series
