# Forms
HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React,
because form elements naturally keep some internal state. For example, this form in plain HTML accepts a single name:
This form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. But in most cases, it’s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of
the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called “controlled components”.

## Controlled Components
In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input.
  An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.
  
## Handling Forms
Handling forms is about how you handle the data when it changes value or gets submitted.

In HTML, form data is usually handled by the DOM.

In React, form data is usually handled by the components.

When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state.

You can control changes by adding event handlers in the onChange attribute:

### Example:

```
class MyForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { username: '' };
  }
  myChangeHandler = (event) => {
    this.setState({username: event.target.value});
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form>
      <h1>Hello {this.state.username}</h1>
      <p>Enter your name:</p>
      <input
        type='text'
        onChange={this.myChangeHandler}
      />
      </form>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<MyForm />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
 ## Conditional Rendering
If you do not want to display the h1 element until the user has done any input, you can add an if statement.

Look at the example below and note the following:

1. We create an empty variable, in this example we call it header.

2. We add an if statement to insert content to the header variable if the user has done any input.

3. We insert the header variable in the output, using curly brackets.

### Example:

```
class MyForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { username: '' };
  }
  myChangeHandler = (event) => {
    this.setState({username: event.target.value});
  }
  render() {
    let header = '';
    if (this.state.username) {
      header = <h1>Hello {this.state.username}</h1>;
    } else {
      header = '';
    }
    return (
      <form>
      {header}
      <p>Enter your name:</p>
      <input
        type='text'
        onChange={this.myChangeHandler}
      />
      </form>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<MyForm />, document.getElementById('root'));
  ```
  
## Multiple Input Fields
You can control the values of more than one input field by adding a name attribute to each element.

When you initialize the state in the constructor, use the field names.

To access the fields in the event handler use the event.target.name and event.target.value syntax.

To update the state in the this.setState method, use square brackets [bracket notation] around the property name.

### Example:
```
class MyForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      username: '',
      age: null,
    };
  }
  myChangeHandler = (event) => {
    let nam = event.target.name;
    let val = event.target.value;
    this.setState({[nam]: val});
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form>
      <h1>Hello {this.state.username} {this.state.age}</h1>
      <p>Enter your name:</p>
      <input
        type='text'
        name='username'
        onChange={this.myChangeHandler}
      />
      <p>Enter your age:</p>
      <input
        type='text'
        name='age'
        onChange={this.myChangeHandler}
      />
      </form>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<MyForm />, document.getElementById('root'));
 ```
  
## Validating Form Input
You can validate form input when the user is typing or you can wait until the form gets submitted.

### Example:
```

class MyForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      username: '',
      age: null,
    };
  }
  myChangeHandler = (event) => {
    let nam = event.target.name;
    let val = event.target.value;
    if (nam === "age") {
      if (!Number(val)) {
        alert("Your age must be a number");
      }
    }
    this.setState({[nam]: val});
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form>
      <h1>Hello {this.state.username} {this.state.age}</h1>
      <p>Enter your name:</p>
      <input
        type='text'
        name='username'
        onChange={this.myChangeHandler}
      />
      <p>Enter your age:</p>
      <input
        type='text'
        name='age'
        onChange={this.myChangeHandler}
      />
      </form>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<MyForm />, document.getElementById('root'));
  ```
  
  ## 1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
  In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself. To write an uncontrolled component,
  instead of writing an event handler for every state update, you can use a ref to get form values from the DOM.
  
  ## 2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them?
  This article will walk you through the basics of using forms in React to allow users to add or edit information. We’ll look at two different ways of working with input controls and the pros and cons of each. We’ll also take a look at how to handle validation, and some third-party libraries for more advanced use cases.

## 3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
  The event also applies to elements with contenteditable enabled, and to any element when designMode is turned on. In the case of contenteditable and designMode, the event target is the editing host. If these properties apply to multiple elements, the editing host is the nearest ancestor element whose parent isn't editable.
  
  
# Conditional (ternary) operator
The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement.
```
  function getFee(isMember) {
  return (isMember ? '$2.00' : '$10.00');
}

console.log(getFee(true));
// expected output: "$2.00"

console.log(getFee(false));
// expected output: "$10.00"

console.log(getFee(null));
// expected output: "$10.00"
```
  ## Syntax
  ```
  condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
  ```


## exprIfTrue
An expression which is evaluated if the condition evaluates to a truthy value (one which equals or can be converted to true).

## exprIfFalse
An expression which is executed if the condition is falsy (that is, has a value which can be converted to false).

## Description
Besides false, possible falsy expressions are: null, NaN, 0, the empty string (""), and undefined. If condition is any of these, the result of the conditional expression will be the result of executing the expression exprIfFalse.
