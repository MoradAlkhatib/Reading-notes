# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

### What is functional programming?
is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
A pure function is a function which: Given the same input, will always return the same output. Produces no side effects.

### What are the benefits of a pure function?
1. They’re easier to reason about
2. They’re easier to combine
3. They’re easier to test
4. They’re easier to debug
5. They’re easier to parallelize
6. They are idempotent
7. They offer referential transparency
8. They are memoizable
9. They can be lazy
### What is immutability?

In JavaScript, only objects and arrays are mutable, not primitive values. (You can make a variable name point to a new value, but the previous value is still held in memory,
Immutables are the objects whose state cannot be changed once the object is created. Strings and Numbers are Immutable.

### What is Referential transparency?

The key differentiating feature of (pure) functional programs is that they provide referential transparency. ... An interesting effect of referential transparency is that it makes your code context-independent, meaning that an expression can be run in any order or in any context and it will always return the same result

# Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

### What is a module?
A module is a software component or part of a program that contains one or more routines.
Modules make a programmer's job easy by allowing the programmer to focus on only one area of the functionality of the software application.
Modules are typically incorporated into the program (software) through interfaces

### What does the word ‘require’ do?
make you use a javascript file in anther file or functions inside this file.

### How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
module.export=function that want to use it in anther file.

### What do we have to do to make a module available?
The first thing you do to get access to module features is export them. This is done using the export statement. You can export functions, var , let , const , and — as we'll see later — classes. They need to be top-level items; you can't use export inside a function, for example.
