# matplotlib
matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB.
Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure,
plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.

## Why Can Matplotlib Be Confusing?
The library itself is huge, at something like 70,000 total lines of code.
Matplotlib is home to several different interfaces (ways of constructing a figure) and capable of interacting with a handful of different backends.
While it is comprehensive, some of matplotlib’s own public documentation is seriously out-of-date. The library is still evolving.

## IPython and the pylab mode 
IPython is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs,
access to shell commands, improved debugging and much more. When we start it with the command line argument -pylab (–pylab since IPython version 0.12),
it allows interactive matplotlib sessions that have Matlab/Mathematica-like functionality.


## Wrapping Up 
As shown by some of the examples above, there’s no getting around the fact that matplotlib can be a technical, syntax-heavy library.
Creating a production-ready chart sometimes requires a half hour of Googling and combining a hodgepodge of lines in order to fine-tune a plot.
