# Hash Tables

Hash tables are a type of data structure in which the address or the index value of the data element is generated from a hash function. That makes accessing the data faster as the index value behaves as a key for the data value. In other words Hash table stores key-value pairs but the key is generated through a hashing function.

So the search and insertion function of a data element becomes much faster as the key values themselves become the index of the array which stores the data.

In Python, the Dictionary data types represent the implementation of hash tables. The Keys in the dictionary satisfy the following requirements.

The keys of the dictionary are hashable i.e. the are generated by hashing function which generates unique result for each unique value supplied to the hash function.

The order of data elements in a dictionary is not fixed.

So we see the implementation of hash table by using the dictionary data types as below.

### Accessing Values in Dictionary
To access dictionary elements, you can use the familiar square brackets along with the key to obtain its value.

Example
```
# Declare a dictionary 
dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Class': 'First'}

# Accessing the dictionary with its key
print "dict['Name']: ", dict['Name']
print "dict['Age']: ", dict['Age']
```

output 
```
dict['Name']:  Zara
dict['Age']:  7
```

### Updating Dictionary
You can update a dictionary by adding a new entry or a key-value pair, modifying an existing entry, or deleting an existing entry 
example
```
# Declare a dictionary
dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Class': 'First'}
dict['Age'] = 8; # update existing entry
dict['School'] = "DPS School"; # Add new entry
print "dict['Age']: ", dict['Age']
print "dict['School']: ", dict['School']
```

Output
```
dict['Age']:  8
dict['School']:  DPS School
```
### Delete Dictionary Elements
You can either remove individual dictionary elements or clear the entire contents of a dictionary. You can also delete entire dictionary in a single operation.
To explicitly remove an entire dictionary, just use the del statement.
Example
```
dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Class': 'First'}
del dict['Name']; # remove entry with key 'Name'
dict.clear();     # remove all entries in dict
del dict ;        # delete entire dictionary

print "dict['Age']: ", dict['Age']
print "dict['School']: ", dict['School']
```
Output
```
dict['Age']:
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test.py", line 8, in <module>
      print "dict['Age']: ", dict['Age'];
TypeError: 'type' object is unsubscriptable
```
## Implementation hash tables
A more standard implementation of Hash Table with Python is presented below. We create three different functions to insert, search, and delete items from the hash table.

Python’s built-in “hash” function is used to create a hash value of any key. This function is useful as it creates an integer hash value for both string and integer key. The hash value for integer will be same as it is, i.e. hash(10) will be 10, hash(20) will be 20, and so on.

In the below code, note the difference in output while using 10 and ’10’. 10 (without quote) is treated as an integer and ’10’ (with quote) is treated as a string.

```
hash_key = hash('xyz')
print (hash_key) # Output: -5999452984703080694

hash_key = hash('10')
print (hash_key) # Output: 6272037681056609

hash_key = hash(10)
print (hash_key) # Output: 10

hash_key = hash('20')
print (hash_key) # Output: 6400038450057764

hash_key = hash(10)
print (hash_key) # Output: 20

hash_key = hash('25')
print (hash_key) # Output: 6400038450057761

hash_key = hash(25)
print (hash_key) # Output: 25


hash_key = hash('10') % len(hash_table)
print (hash_key) # Output: 9

hash_key = hash('20') % len(hash_table)
print (hash_key) # Output: 4

hash_key = hash('25') % len(hash_table)
print (hash_key) # Output: 1

hash_key = hash(10) % len(hash_table)
print (hash_key) # Output: 0

hash_key = hash(20) % len(hash_table)
print (hash_key) # Output: 0

hash_key = hash(25) % len(hash_table)
print (hash_key) # Output: 5
```
