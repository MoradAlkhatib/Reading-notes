### Django Web Development in Python
Django is a widely used free, open-source, and high-level web development framework.
It provides a lot of features to the developers "out of the box," so development can be rapid.
However, websites built from it are secured, scalable, and maintainable at the same time.

### To create your app 
make sure you’re in the same directory as manage.py and type this command:
$ python manage.py startapp polls
To call the view, we need to map it to a URL - and for this we need a URLconf.
To create a URLconf in the polls directory, create a file called urls.py.
The path() function is passed four arguments, two required: route and view, and two optional: kwargs, and name. At this point, it’s worth reviewing what these arguments are for.
route is a string that contains a URL pattern. When processing a request, Django starts at the first pattern in urlpatterns and makes its way down the list, comparing the requested URL against each pattern until it finds one that matches.
view When Django finds a matching pattern, it calls the specified view function with an HttpRequest object as the first argument and any “captured” values from the route as keyword arguments. We’ll give an example of this in a bit.
kwargs Arbitrary keyword arguments can be passed in a dictionary to the target view. We aren’t going to use this feature of Django in the tutorial.
name Naming your URL lets you refer to it unambiguously from elsewhere in Django, especially from within templates. This powerful feature allows you to make global changes to the URL patterns of your project while only touching a single file.

### How Django processes a request
When a user requests a page from your Django-powered site, this is the algorithm the system follows to determine which Python code to execute:
Django determines the root URLconf module to use. Ordinarily, this is the value of the ROOT_URLCONF setting, but if the incoming HttpRequest object has a urlconf attribute (set by middleware), its value will be used in place of the ROOT_URLCONF setting.
Django loads that Python module and looks for the variable urlpatterns. This should be a sequence of django.urls.path() and/or django.urls.re_path() instances.
Django runs through each URL pattern, in order, and stops at the first one that matches the requested URL, matching against path_info.
Once one of the URL patterns matches, Django imports and calls the given view, which is a Python function (or a class-based view). The view gets passed the following arguments:
An instance of HttpRequest.
If the matched URL pattern contained no named groups, then the matches from the regular expression are provided as positional arguments.
The keyword arguments are made up of any named parts matched by the path expression that are provided, overridden by any arguments specified in the optional kwargs argument to django.urls.path() or django.urls.re_path().
If no URL pattern matches, or if an exception is raised during any point in this process, Django invokes an appropriate error-handling view. See Error handling below.

### How Django Works Behind the Scenes
Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram. 
It is open source, meaning the code is available for free on Github and can be downloaded onto any developer’s computer and used alongside the official documentation.
However, I find that even professional Django developers have little insight into “how” Django is actually run, both technically and legally/financially, so this post is my attempt to provide a concise overview of it all.


### Django Software Foundation
The DSF supports and maintains Django in a number of capacities. The largest expense, by far, is the Fellows Program, paid contractors who triage tickets, manage releases, and generally perform the unsexy but necessary work needed to keep Django on track.

### Technical Organization
The DSF handles legal, financial, and administrative matters for Django. But there is a separate organizational structure for the technical team.

Historically, Django followed Python’s model of having a Benevolent Dictator for Life, that is, a project founder who retained final say for disputes/arguments within the community. Adrian Holovaty and Jacob Kaplan-Moss functioned as Django’s dual-BDFLs from 2005 until their retirement in 2014.
