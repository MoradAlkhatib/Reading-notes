# Read & Write Files in Python


Write to an Existing File
To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the open() function:

"a" - Append - will append to the end of the file

"w" - Write - will overwrite any existing content

Create a New File
To create a new file in Python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters:

"x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exist

"a" - Append - will create a file if the specified file does not exist

"w" - Write - will create a file if the specified file does not exist


# Exceptions in Python
What is Exception?
An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's
instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception.
An exception is a Python object that represents an error.

When a Python script raises an exception, it must either handle the exception immediately otherwise it terminates and quits.

Handling an exception
If you have some suspicious code that may raise an exception, you can defend your program by placing the suspicious code in a try: block. After the try: block, include an except: statement, followed by a block of code which handles the problem as elegantly as possible.

Here are few important points about the above-mentioned syntax −

A single try statement can have multiple except statements. This is useful when the try block contains statements that may throw different types of exceptions.

You can also provide a generic except clause, which handles any exception.

After the except clause(s), you can include an else-clause. The code in the else-block executes if the code in the try: block does not raise an exception.

The else-block is a good place for code that does not need the try: block's protection.

The try-finally Clause
You can use a finally: block along with a try: block. The finally block is a place to put any code that must execute, whether the try-block raised an exception or not. The syntax of the try-finally statement is this −

try:
   You do your operations here;
   ......................
   Due to any exception, this may be skipped.
finally:
   This would always be executed.
   ......................
