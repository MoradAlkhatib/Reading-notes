# React.Component
This page contains a detailed API reference for the React component class definition. It assumes you‚Äôre familiar with fundamental React concepts, such as Components and Props, as well as State and Lifecycle. If you‚Äôre not, read them first.

### Overview
React lets you define components as classes or functions. Components defined as classes currently provide more features which are described in detail on this page. To define a React component class, you need to extend React.Component:

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
The only method you must define in a React.Component subclass is called render(). All the other methods described on this page are optional.

We strongly recommend against creating your own base component classes. In React components, code reuse is primarily achieved through composition rather than inheritance.

### The Component Lifecycle
Each component has several ‚Äúlifecycle methods‚Äù that you can override to run code at particular times in the process. You can use this lifecycle diagram as a cheat sheet. In the list below, commonly used lifecycle methods are marked as bold. The rest of them exist for relatively rare use cases.

Mounting
These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

constructor()
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()

### Updating
An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered:

static getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidUpdate()
Error Handling
These methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.

static getDerivedStateFromError()
componentDidCatch()
Other APIs
Each component also provides some other APIs:

setState()
forceUpdate()
Class Properties
defaultProps
displayName
Instance Properties
props
state
# What are Props in React and How to They Work?
If you‚Äôre already familiar with how arguments & functions work in JavaScript, understanding props is a piece of cake! In a nutshell, props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React and they are the main mechanism for component communication. So in essence, props are a major part of what allows the React component pattern to work.

Like most great inventions there‚Äôs always a simple core idea that holds everything together. In React, it‚Äôs arguably the props system that allows you to treat React components just like JavaScript functions.

Props === Function Parameters
What would you say if I told you that you already know what ‚Äúprops‚Äù are? Well, if you know JavaScript‚Ä¶ You do!

Consider this vanilla JavaScript function:

function Greeter(name) {
  return 'hello ' +name;
}
 
It has a single parameter called name. Passing different arguments to the parameter yields different results:

Greeter('world')
// --> "hello world"

Greeter('dolly')
// --> "hello dolly"

Greeter('its me')
// --> "hello its me"
 
How does this relate to React?
You can think of a React component as essentially a JavaScript function. Let‚Äôs create a React component to illustrate this point:

function Greeter(props) {
  return <p>hello {props.name}</p>
};
 
And invoking the <Greeter/> component‚Ä¶

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>HELLO APP</h1>
      <Greeter name="world"/>  {/* üí• "world" is the prop value*/}
    </div>
  )
};
 
You just passed a prop value to <Greeter/> and now the Greeter component will have access to the value of the name prop! That, in a nutshell, is all props are! Instead of invoking Greeter like this:

Greeter('some value');
// --> "some value"
 
You invoke it with this HTML-esque syntax called JSX:

<Greeter name="some value"/>
// --> <p>hello some value</p>
 
And Greeter gets access to the props passed to it like so:

import React from 'react';

function Greeter(props) {
  return (
    <p>hello {props.name}</p>
  )
}

export default Greeter;
 
This syntax of passing props in React is from the HTML world where attributes are used to bestow certain ‚Äúproperties‚Äù to an HTML element‚Ä¶ Hence the abbreviated word props

So far, we‚Äôve only used strings but props can take any native JavaScript type (eg., arrays, boolean values, object literals, functions).

As a newcomer to React, you may be tempted to think of props as something totally new and strange. Instead try thinking of them simply as arguments that you‚Äôre supplying to a function‚Ä¶ because at its core that‚Äôs all they are.
