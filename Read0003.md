# Passing Functions as Props
## React Docs - lists and keys
### 1. What does .map() return?
the map() in React return elements of array after do something on its an dyou can assignment to the another array

### 2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
you can use forEach() or map() to through on array and display it in JSX inside { }
#### example:
```
function App() {
  return (
 {users.map((user, index) => (
          <div key={index}>+
          /*/
            <h3>{user}</h3>
            <p>{index}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
        
        )
        }
```
        
### 3. Each list item needs a unique Key

### 4. What is the purpose of a key?
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity
example:

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li key={number.toString()}>
    {number}
  </li>
);
```
## The Spread Operator
### 1. What is the spread operator?
The Spread operator lets you expand an iterable like an object, string, or array into its elements while the Rest operator does the inverse by reducing a set of elements into one array

### 2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
Using an array as arguments
Adding an item to a list
Adding to state in React
Combining objects
Converting NodeList to an array

### 3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
```
let arr1=[1,2,5,3,6,9];
let arr2=[5,9,7,9];
let arr3=[...arr1,...arr2];
```
### 4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
```
let arr1=['a','b','s','d'];
let arr2=['k','z',...arr1];
```
### 5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
```
let obj1={neme:murad,
age:24,
play:football
}
let obj2={study:programming,
have:comuter,

}

let obj={...obj1,...obj2}
```
## How to Pass Functions Between Components
### 1. In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?
props you can use the props after use attribut in claas you can use props in another class
### 2. In your own words, what does the increment function do?
that take value from chind class to parent class and compare it with state names to find a match. 

### 3. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?
use props
### 4. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
invoke function from parent use props insied a owen fuction and passed a prrameters inside parent function to make this value passing from child to parent. 
invoke function from parent use props inside a own function for child and passed a parameters inside parent function , and invoked parents function use child function inside event to make this value passing from child to parents.
