# What We're Building
Today, we're going to build an interactive tic-tac-toe game. We'll assume some familiarity with HTML and JavaScript but you should be able to follow along even if you haven't used them before.

If you like, you can check out the final result here: Final Result. Try playing the game. You can also click on a link in the move list to go "back in time" and see what the board looked like just after that move was made.

# What is React?
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React has a few different kinds of components, but we'll start with React.Component subclasses:

```
class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="shopping-list">
        <h1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Instagram</li>
          <li>WhatsApp</li>
          <li>Oculus</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
We'll get to the funny XML-like tags in a second. Your components tell React what you want to render – then React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

Here, ShoppingList is a React component class, or React component type. A component takes in parameters, called props, and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.

The render method return a description of what you want to render, and then React takes that description and renders it to the screen. In particular, render returns a React element, which is a lightweight description of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called JSX which makes it easier to write these structures. The <div /> syntax is transformed at build time to React.createElement('div'). The example above is equivalent to:
```
return React.createElement('div', {className: 'shopping-list'},
  React.createElement('h1', ...),
  React.createElement('ul', ...)
);
```
You can put any JavaScript expression within braces inside JSX. Each React element is a real JavaScript object that you can store in a variable or pass around your program.

The ShoppingList component only renders built-in DOM components, but you can compose custom React components just as easily, by writing <ShoppingList />. Each component is encapsulated so it can operate independently, which allows you to build complex UIs out of simple components.

## Getting Started
Start with this example: Starter Code.

It contains the shell of what we're building today. We've provided the styles so you only need to worry about the JavaScript.

In particular, we have three components:

Square
Board
Game
The Square component renders a single <div>, the Board renders 9 squares, and the Game component renders a board with some placeholders that we'll fill in later. None of the components are interactive at this point.

(The end of the JS file also defines a helper function calculateWinner that we'll use later.)

## Passing Data Through Props
Just to get our feet wet, let's try passing some data from the Board component to the Square component. In Board's renderSquare method, change the code to return <Square value={i} /> then change Square's render method to show that value by replacing {/* TODO */} with
  
## Lifting State Up
We now have the basic building blocks for a tic-tac-toe game. But right now, the state is encapsulated in each Square component. To make a fully-working game, we now need to check if one player has won the game, and alternate placing X and O in the squares. To check if someone has won, we'll need to have the value of all 9 squares in one place, rather than split up across the Square components.

You might think that Board should just inquire what the current state of each Square is. Although it is technically possible to do this in React, it is discouraged because it tends to make code difficult to understand, more brittle, and harder to refactor.

Instead, the best solution here is to store this state in the Board component instead of in each Square – and the Board component can tell each Square what to display, like how we made each square display its index earlier.

When you want to aggregate data from multiple children or to have two child components communicate with each other, move the state upwards so that it lives in the parent component. The parent can then pass the state back down to the children via props, so that the child components are always in sync with each other and with the parent.

Pulling state upwards like this is common when refactoring React components, so let's take this opportunity to try it out. Add an initial state for
  Board containing an array with 9 nulls, corresponding to the 9 squares
  
## Why Immutability Is Important
In the previous code example, I suggest using the .slice() operator to copy the squares array prior to making changges and to prevent mutating the existing array. Let's talk about what this means and why it an important concept to learn.

There are generally two ways for changing data. The first, and most common method in past, has been to mutate the data by directly 
  changing the values of a variable. The second method is to replace the data with a new copy of the object that also includes desired changes.
  The end result is the same but by not mutating (or changing the underlying data) directly we now have an added benefit that can help us increase component and overall application performance.

## Tracking Changes
Determining if a mutated object has changed is complex because changes are made directly to the object. This then requires comparing the current object to a previous copy, traversing the entire object tree, and comparing each variable and value. This process can become increasingly complex.

Determining how a immutable object has changed is considerably easier. If the object being referenced is different from before, then the object has changed. That's it.

## Determining When To Re-render in React
The biggest benefit of immutability in React comes when you build simple pure components. Since immutable data can more easily determine if changes have been made it also helps to determine when a component requires being re-rendered.

To learn how you can build pure components take a look at shouldComponentUpdate(). Also, take a look at the immutability.js library to strictly enforce immutable data.

## Functional Components
Back to our project, you can now delete the constructor from Square; we won't need it any more. In fact, React supports a simpler syntax called stateless functional
  components for component types like Square that only consist of a render method. Rather than define a class extending React.Component, simply write a function that takes
  props and returns what should be rendered
  
## Wrapping Up
Now, you've made a tic-tac-toe game that:

lets you play tic-tac-toe,
indicates when one player has won the game,
stores the history of moves during the game,
allows players to jump back in time to see older versions of the game board.
Nice work! We hope you now feel like you have a decent grasp on how React works.

If you have extra time or want to practice your new skills, here are some ideas for improvements you could make, listed in order of increasing difficulty:

Display the move locations in the format "(1, 3)" instead of "6".
Bold the currently-selected item in the move list.
Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
