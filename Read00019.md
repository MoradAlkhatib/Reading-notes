# Regular expressions
Regular expressions (called REs, or regexes, or regex patterns) are essentially a tiny,
highly specialized programming language embedded inside Python and made available through the re module.
Using this little language, you specify the rules for the set of possible strings that you want to match;
this set might contain English sentences, or e-mail addresses, or TeX commands, or anything you like.
You can then ask questions such as “Does this string match the pattern?”, or “Is there a match for the pattern anywhere in this string?”.
You can also use REs to modify a string or to split it apart in various ways.

## Simple Patterns
We’ll start by learning about the simplest possible regular expressions. Since regular expressions are used to operate on strings, we’ll begin with the most common task: matching characters.

For a detailed explanation of the computer science underlying regular expressions (deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata), you can refer to almost any textbook on writing compilers.

## Matching Characters
Most letters and characters will simply match themselves. For example, the regular expression test will match the string test exactly. (You can enable a case-insensitive mode that would let this RE match Test or TEST as well; more about this later.)

## Repeating Things
Being able to match varying sets of characters is the first thing regular expressions can do that isn’t already possible with the methods available on strings. However, if that was the only additional capability of regexes, they wouldn’t be much of an advance. Another capability is that you can specify that portions of the RE must be repeated a certain number of times.
Using Regular Expressions
Now that we’ve looked at some simple regular expressions, how do we actually use them in Python? The re module provides an interface to the regular expression engine, allowing you to compile REs into objects and then perform matches with them.

## Compiling Regular Expressions
Regular expressions are compiled into pattern objects, which have methods for various operations such as searching for pattern matches or performing string substitutions.

```
>>> import re
>>> p = re.compile('ab*')
>>> p
re.compile('ab*')
```
# shutil — High-level file operations
The shutil module offers a number of high-level operations on files and collections of files. In particular, functions are provided which support file copying and removal. For operations on individual files, see also the os module.

## Directory and files operations
shutil.copyfileobj(fsrc, fdst[, length])
Copy the contents of the file-like object fsrc to the file-like object fdst. The integer length, if given, is the buffer size. In particular, a negative length value means to copy the data without looping over the source data in chunks; by default the data is read in chunks to avoid uncontrolled memory consumption. Note that if the current file position of the fsrc object is not 0, only the contents from the current file position to the end of the file will be copied.

## Platform-dependent efficient copy operations
Starting from Python 3.8, all functions involving a file copy (copyfile(), copy(), copy2(), copytree(), and move()) may use platform-specific “fast-copy” syscalls in order to copy the file more efficiently (see bpo-33671). “fast-copy” means that the copying operation occurs within the kernel, avoiding the use of userspace buffers in Python as in “outfd.write(infd.read())”.

## copytree example
```
def copytree(src, dst, symlinks=False):
    names = os.listdir(src)
    os.makedirs(dst)
    errors = []
    for name in names:
        srcname = os.path.join(src, name)
        dstname = os.path.join(dst, name)
        try:
            if symlinks and os.path.islink(srcname):
                linkto = os.readlink(srcname)
                os.symlink(linkto, dstname)
            elif os.path.isdir(srcname):
                copytree(srcname, dstname, symlinks)
            else:
                copy2(srcname, dstname)
            # XXX What about devices, sockets etc.?
        except OSError as why:
            errors.append((srcname, dstname, str(why)))
        # catch the Error from the recursive copytree so that we can
        # continue with other files
        except Error as err:
            errors.extend(err.args[0])
    try:
        copystat(src, dst)
    except OSError as why:
        # can't copy file access times on Windows
        if why.winerror is None:
            errors.extend((src, dst, str(why)))
    if errors:
        raise Error(errors)
```
