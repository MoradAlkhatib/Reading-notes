# Why Test-Driven Development is required?
Based on Agile Lean development practices, to deliver a robust usable software to end-users at a quick pace, we need to continuously deliver software to end-users, get their feedback, and implement the feedback and deploy to production on demand.
To ensure that our code changes have not broken any of the pre-existing functionality, we need to perform extensive unit testing, functional testing and user acceptance testing. If done manually, then is a time-consuming effort or follow a test-driven development practice.
## TDD Approach
In TDD, we write a failed test case first and then writing the production code to make the test case pass. Finally, we check for any code refactoring opportunities.
## High code coverage
We write unit test cases with high code coverage. This ensures that bugs will not creep into our production code and are detected as part of the testing done using TDD.
## Code changes made easy
If we do not follow TDD then implementing changes over a period of time becomes so error prone that fixing one functionality of code breaks other some other functionality.

# Python Modules Explained
Python files are called modules and they are identified by the .py file extension. A module can define functions, classes, and variables.

So when the interpreter runs a module, the __name__ variable will be set as  __main__ if the module that is being run is the main program.

But if the code is importing the module from another module, then the __name__  variable will be set to that module’s name.

## Conclusion
There is a really nice use case for the __name__ variable, whether you want a file that can be run as the main program or imported by other modules. We can use an if __name__ == "__main__" block to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the modules are imported.

When the Python interpreter reads a file, the __name__ variable is set as __main__ if the module being run, or as the module's name if it is imported. Reading the file executes all top level code, but not functions and classes (since they will only get imported).

# Recursive Functions in Python
Now that we have some intuition about recursion, let’s introduce the formal definition of a recursive function. A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.

This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.

To demonstrate this structure, let’s write a recursive function for calculating n!:

Decompose the original problem into simpler instances of the same problem. This is the recursive case:
```
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2 x 1
n! = n x (n−1)!
As the large problem is broken down into successively less complex ones, those subproblems must eventually become so simple that they can be solved without further subdivision. This is the base case:

n! = n x (n−1)! 
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2)!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3)!
⋅
⋅
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2 x 1!
```
