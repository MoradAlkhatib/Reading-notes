# Classes and Objects
How to create a class
To define a class in Python, you can use the class keyword, followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, an __init__ method has to be defined with def. This is the initializer that you can later use to instantiate objects. It's similar to a constructor in Java. __init__ must always be present! It takes one argument: self,
which refers to the object itself. Inside the method, the pass keyword is used as of now, because Python expects you to type something there. Remember to use correct indentation!

Note: self in Python is equivalent to this in C++ or Java.

In this case, you have a (mostly empty) Dog class, but no object yet. Let's create one!

Instantiating objects
To instantiate an object, type the class name, followed by two brackets. You can assign this to a variable to keep track of the object.
# Thinking Recursively
Train Your Mind to Think Recursively in 5 Steps
1. Use the iterable-approach first.
This step is relatively simple for most people. We have a number and want to sum its digits using loops. Basically, we need to know how to count how many digits in the number and then sum them up one by one.
2. Extract the parameters of your function.
Solving the problem using loops will help us understand the answer and figure out all the non-recursive aspects of it. Now that we have the answer, we can dissect it and extract the information we need to move on.
3. Deduct minimal problem instance.
Once we get the function parameters, we are going to give them a deeper look. In our case, we only have one parameter that is num.
What we need to do now is find the minimal problem instance based on its parameters. To recall, our purpose was to sum the digits of a given number. The easiest instance of this problem is if the number only has one digit.
4. Add the solution to the minimal problem instance.
Let’s look again at the function we just wrote:
def sumOfDigitsIter(num):
    num = str(num)
    s = 0
    for i in range(len(num)):
        s += int(num[i])
    return s
Following this function's logic, if the parameter num is only one digit, the loop will still be executed. To avoid that, we can add a conditional statement that only executes if the number of digits in the input number is one.
def SumOfDigitsIter(num):
    num = str(num)
    if len(num) == 1:
      return num
    else:
      s = 0
      for i in range(len(num)):
          s += int(num[i])
      return s
      
5. Expand your function.
This is the step where recursion happens. Up until now, we didn’t care much about recursion; we were solving the problem logically. That’s the best approach to start with recursion, think about it logically, and then convert into a recursive solution.
Now, let’s consider the else section of our function.
else:
      s = 0
      for i in range(len(num)):
          s += int(num[i])
      return s
You can think of recursion as unrolling a problem instance and then rolling it again. We can look at this problem from another angle, we can say that the sum of 123 is 1 + the sum of 23, and the sum of 23 is 2 + sum 3 — which is 3.
So, rolling back this becomes the sume of 123 = 1 +2 +3 =6.
Let’s convert that into code. We already have the last part written, which handles one-digit numbers. What we need to do is break the rest of the num variables into one-digit numbers.
That’s recursion.
def SumOfDigits2(num):
 num = str(num)
 if len(num) == 1:
   return num
 else:
   return num[0] + sumOfDigits(num[1:])
So, every time, I call the same function but with a smaller input. Once I reach the last digit, I will end up with something like 1 + 2 + 3, which will eventually add up to 6.
And, voila, I got myself a recursive function.

# Pytest Fixtures and Coverage
Python Testing with pytest: Fixtures and Coverage
Improve your Python testing even more.

In my last two articles, I introduced pytest, a library for testing Python code (see "Testing Your Code with Python's pytest" Part I and Part II). pytest has become quite popular, in no small part because it's so easy to write tests and integrate those tests into your software development process. I've become a big fan, mostly because after years of saying I should get better about testing my software, pytest finally has made it possible.

So in this article, I review two features of pytest that I haven't had a chance to cover yet: fixtures and code coverage, which will (I hope) convince you that pytest is worth exploring and incorporating into your work.

Fixtures
When you're writing tests, you're rarely going to write just one or two. Rather, you're going to write an entire "test suite", with each test aiming to check a different path through your code. In many cases, this means you'll have a few tests with similar characteristics, something that pytest handles with "parametrized tests".

But in other cases, things are a bit more complex. You'll want to have some objects available to all of your tests. Those objects might contain data you want to share across tests, or they might involve the network or filesystem. These are often known as "fixtures" in the testing world, and they take a variety of different forms.
