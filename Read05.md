JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:


# Lops

#### In computer science, a loop is a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met. Programmers use loops to cycle through values, add sums of numbers, repeat functions, and many other things.


## JavaScript Loops
#### Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again,each time with a different value.
#### Often this is the case when working with arrays.

# Type Of Loops

## 1. For Loops     [FOR](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp)
## 1. While Loops   [While](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_while.asp)
## 1. Do While Loops [Do While](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_dowhile.asp)

### And in the end of Loops yo should know about break&continue
### And How You Can Use them incide Loops
