# Dunder Methods
Magic methods in Python are the special methods that start and end with the double underscores. They are also called dunder methods. Magic methods are not meant to be invoked directly by you, but the invocation happens internally from the class on a certain action. For example, when you add two numbers using the + operator, internally, the __add__() method will be called.

Built-in classes in Python define many magic methods. Use the dir() function to see the number of magic methods inherited by a class. For example, the following lists all the attributes and methods defined in the int class.

## __new__() method
Languages such as Java and C# use the new operator to create a new instance of a class. In Python the __new__() magic method is implicitly called before the __init__() method. The __new__() method returns a new object, which is then initialized by __init__().

## __str__() method
Another useful magic method is __str__(). It is overridden to return a printable string representation of any user defined class. We have seen str() built-in function which returns a string from the object parameter. For example, str(12) returns '12'. When invoked, it calls the __str__() method in the int class.

## __add__() method
In following example, a class named distance is defined with two instance attributes - ft and inch. The addition of these two distance objects is desired to be performed using the overloading + operator.

To achieve this, the magic method __add__() is overridden, which performs the addition of the ft and inch attributes of the two objects. The __str__() method returns the object's string representation.

# Statistics - Probability
## Python Statistics & Probability Theory
The first topic that you should probably tackle is statistics and probability theory. There are not only quite some videos and courses out there that can help you, but there are also a lot of (printed) books that will help you to get started with statistics in Python.

## Statistics With Python  

For an introduction to statistics, this tutorial with real-life examples is the way to go. The notebooks of this tutorial will introduce you to concepts like mean, median, standard deviation, and the basics of topics such as hypothesis testing and probability distributions.

A fine way to start your stats learning, since it is inspired by the books "Think Bayes" and "Think Stats", which are two top recommendations that will come back below!

If you’re looking for books, you can try out this free book on computational statistics in Python, which not only contains an introduction to programming with Python, but also treats topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, resampling methods, and much more.

## robability Theory with Python

Probability theory is also something that is highly valuable to take into account when you’re learning statistics with Python. It’s the analysis of random phenomena. That means that the outcome of any random event is non-deterministic: it can be any of the several possible outcomes, and the eventual outcome is determined by chance.

Probability theory contains the conceptual origins of statistics.

The resources that have been mentioned above gave a general introduction to statistics and, in some cases they also covered probability theory (which seems reasonable given the above), but there are also resources that exclusively focus on this topic.
