# Linear Regression in Python
Linear regression is a basic predictive analytics technique that uses historical data to predict an output variable.
It is popular for predictive modelling because it is easily understood and can be explained using plain English.

Linear regression models have many real-world applications in an array of industries such as economics (e.g. predicting growth),
business (e.g. predicting product sales, employee performance), social science (e.g. predicting political leanings from gender or race), 
healthcare (e.g. predicting blood pressure levels from weight, disease onset from biological factors), and more.
Understanding how to implement linear regression models can unearth stories in data to solve important problems. 
We’ll use Python as it is a robust tool to handle, process, and model data. It has an array of packages for linear regression modelling.

## Basic concepts and mathematics
There are two kinds of variables in a linear regression model:
### - The input or predictor variable is the variable(s) that help predict the value of the output variable. It is commonly referred to as X.
### - The output variable is the variable that we want to predict. It is commonly referred to as Y.
To estimate Y using linear regression, we assume the equation:
Yₑ = α + β X




## Data Analysis Plan
Edit your research questions and null/alternative hypotheses

Write your data analysis plan; specify specific statistics to address the research questions, the assumptions of the statistics, and justify why they are the appropriate statistics; provide references

Justify your sample size/power analysis, provide references

Explain your data analysis plan to you so you are comfortable and confident

Two hours of additional support with your statistician



Exploring Boston Housing Data Set
```
import required Python libraries into Ipython Notebook
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plot
import sklearn

import data set and store it in a variable called boston.
from sklean.datasets import load_boston
boston = load_bost()
```
