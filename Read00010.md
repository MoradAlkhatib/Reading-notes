# Stacks and Queues
 
## Stack
Stacks, like the name suggests, follow the Last-in-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
As if stacking coins one on top of the other, the last coin we put on the top is the one that is the first to be removed from the stack later.
push - adds an element to the top of the stack:


pop - removes the element at the top of the stack:

Queues, like the name suggests, follow the First-in-First-Out (FIFO) principle. As if waiting in a queue for the movie tickets,
the first one to stand in line is the first one to buy a ticket and enjoy the movie.

To implement a queue, therefore, we need two simple operations:

enqueue - adds an element to the end of the queue:

dequeue - removes the element at the beginning of the queue:
