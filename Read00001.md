# A Beginner’s Guide to Big O Notation

When we write code, it’s important to understand how our choice of code impacts the speed and performance of the program we’re creating. Big O Notation is a way to classify how quickly the runtime of the algorithm/number of operations or space increases in relation to the input n. It looks at the worst case scenario, assuming every possible element is touched on as the algorithm is written.
There are seven classifications in Big O Notation, ranging from fantastic, fast and/or space efficient solutions that remain constant despite the input size, to absolutely terrible, please-don’t-ever-use-these solutions!

What would the Big O notation time complexity of those operations be?
Each of these operations (grabbing the ingredient, pushing it into the ingredients array) takes constant time, or O(1). The number of operations doesn’t grow with the size of the array or the size of the kitchen object. We have direct access to each element to grab exactly what we need, so the time complexity does not change.
Here’s another example:
```
function addDigitsUpToNumber(n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2
}
```
addDigitsUpToNumber(5) // 15, same as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
In this function, we add up all of the digits, from 1 to n, and return the sum by using a quick math trick. This function also has O(1) time complexity because it takes the exact same number of operations regardless of whether n is equal to 5, 10, 1,000 or 1,000,000,000.

O(n) Linear Time
To start preparing ratatouille, you first have to chop the ingredients:
```
let ingredients = ["zucchini", "eggplant", "squash", "tomato", "redPepper", "onion", "garlic", "herbesDeProvence"]
function chop(ingredients) {
    for (let i = 0; i < ingredients.length; i++) {
        console.log(`${ingredients[i]} has been chopped!`)
    } 
}
```
How long should our chop function take to complete? Better yet, how many operations need to take place?
Since there are seven elements in our ingredients array and the function iterates through each one once (chopping as we go), we could say that seven operations need to take place (O(7)). If we added additional n ingredients to our array, this function would take n operations since it needs to touch upon each one of those elements once, otherwise known as O(n).
O(n) time complexity is also known as linear time and is generally considered an efficient solution. It isn’t as good or as fast as O(1) or O(log n), which we’ll get to later, but usually this time complexity is considered acceptable.

O(n²) Quadratic Time
As Chef Remy, you hear that famed restaurant critic (and notorious grump) Anton Ego is coming to judge your food for the first time.

He will accept only the best, so you decide to sort through all your chopped vegetables to find the best ones for his ratatouille. Let’s pretend that each slice has a rating from 1–n, with 1 being the best slice and n being the worst:
```
let zucchiniSlices = [20, 11, 25, 3, 14, 5,...]
function sortByBestSlices(veggieSlices) {
    for (let i = 0; i < veggieSlices.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < veggieSlices.length; j++) {
            if (veggieSlices[i] < veggieSlices[j]) {
                let temp = veggieSlices[i];
                veggieSlices[i] = veggieSlices[j];
                veggieSlices[j] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
    return veggieSlices
}
```


# Python Names and Values

Python is a very approachable language. Often it works just as you expect if you come to it from other languages. But you might suddenly encounter surprising behavior.

The underlying mechanisms of Python are often quite simple, but their combined effects might not be what you expect. By understanding the mechanisms, you can reason about their effects.

1-nams are assigned independintly

2- names refers to the value (not to other names)

3- in python memroy is managed dynamicly (vaule live untill there is now referce to it)

4- asssignment never copy data (only refer to the same value and not copy it) so if you change a value in (ex:list) all the names will have that change because they all refer to the same list (this is the cast in mutable data type)

5- in imutable data type (string,tuples,int) when change there values the new value value wont be stored in that refernce but it will store the value in new reffernce (do not change in place)
