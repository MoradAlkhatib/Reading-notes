# How to use Random Module

### Python - Random Module
The random module is a built-in module to generate the pseudo-random variables.(import random)
It can be used perform some action randomly such as to get a random number, selecting a random elements from a list, shuffle elements randomly, etc.
```
>>> import random
>>> random.random()
0.645173684807533
```
### Generate Random Integers
The random.randint() method returns a random integer between the specified integers.
```
>>> import random
>>> random.randint(1, 100)
95  
```
Generate Random Numbers within Range
The random.randrange() method returns a randomly selected element from the range created by the start, stop and step arguments.
The value of start is 0 by default. Similarly, the value of step is 1 by default.
```
>>> random.randrange(1, 10)
2
>>> random.randrange(1, 10, 2)
5 
```
Select Random Elements
The random.choice() method returns a randomly selected element from a non-empty sequence. An empty sequence as argument raises an IndexError.
```
>>> random.choice('computer')
't'          
>>> random.choice([12,23,45,67,65,43])
45
```
Shuffle Elements Randomly
The random.shuffle() method randomly reorders the elements in a
```
>>> numbers=[12,23,45,67,65,43]
>>> random.shuffle(numbers)
```
# What Is Risk Analysis?
Risk Analysis is a process that helps you to identify and manage potential problems that could undermine key business initiatives or projects.
However, it can also be applied to other projects outside of business, such as organizing events or even buying a home!

To carry out a Risk Analysis, you must first identify the possible threats that you face, then estimate their likely impacts if they were to happen,
and finally estimate the likelihood that these threats will materialize.

Risk Analysis can be complex, as you'll need to draw on detailed information such as project plans, financial data, security protocols,
marketing forecasts, and other relevant information. However, it's an essential planning tool, and one that could save time, money, and reputations.

### When to Use Risk Analysis
Risk analysis is useful in many situations:
- When you're planning projects, to help you to anticipate and neutralize possible problems.
- When you're deciding whether or not to move forward with a project.
- When you're improving safety and managing potential risks in the workplace.
- When you're preparing for events such as equipment or technology failure, theft, staff sickness, or natural disasters.
- When you're planning for changes in your environment, such as new competitors coming into the market, or changes to government policy.

### How to Use Risk Analysis 
follow these steps:
#### 1. Identify Threats
The first step in Risk Analysis is to identify the existing and possible threats that you might face. 

#### 2. Estimate Risk
Once you've identified the threats you're facing, you need to calculate both the likelihood of these threats being realized, and their possible impact.

One way of doing this is to make your best estimate of the probability of the event occurring, and then to multiply this by the amount it will cost you to set things right if it happens. This gives you a value for the risk:

#### Risk Value = Probability of Event x Cost of Event

### How to Manage Risk
Once you've identified the value of the risks you face, you can start to look at ways of managing them.

Tip:
Look for cost-effective approaches – it's rarely sensible to spend more on eliminating a risk than the cost of the event if it occurs.
It may be better to accept the risk than it is to use excessive resources to eliminate it.

Be sensible in how you apply this, though, especially if ethics or personal safety are in question.

# Test Coverage 
A useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase.It’s of little use as a numeric statement of how good your tests are,
and we use it to know if we are testing enough or not.

# Big O
essentially an equation that describes how the run time scales with respect to some input variables, and its depend on the worst case .

Rules :
- constants are always droped.
- add up different steps in given algorithm algorithm.
- drop non dominate terms
- diffirent inputs > diffirent variables.
