| SQL           | 	NoSQL         | 
| :------------ |:---------------:| 
| static        | 	daynamic      | 
| vertical      | horizantal      |     
|require a downtime|no outage required|
| structured query language |Un- structured query language  | 


2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined

3. Give a real world example
if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records ,conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.

Semi-structured or Unstructured data / flexible schema. Limited pre-defined access paths and query patterns. No complex queries, stored procedures, or views. High velocity transactions.


5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
SQL databases

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
SQL databases
