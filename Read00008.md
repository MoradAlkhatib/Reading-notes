# List Comprehensions in Python
List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.
Syntax
Consider the following example:
```
my_new_list = [ expression for item in list ]

```
You can see from this example that three ingredients are necessary for a python list comprehension to work.

First is the expression we’d like to carry out. expression inside the square brackets.
Second is the object that the expression will work on. item inside the square brackets.
Finally, we need an iterable list of objects to build our new list from. list inside the square brackets.
To understand the list comprehension, imagine it like this: you’re going to perform an expression on each item in the list. The expression will determine what item is eventually stored in the output list. 

Not only can you perform expressions on an entire list in a single line of code, but, as we’ll see later, it’s possible to add conditional statements in the form of filters, which allows for more precision in the way lists are handled.

Notes about Lists Comprehensions
List comprehension methods are an elegant way to create and manage lists. 
In Python, list comprehensions are a more compact way of creating lists. 
More flexible than for loops, list comprehension is usually faster than other methods.

# Primer on Decorators
A decorator gives you the ability to take existing functions or classes, add some functionality, and return them without changing the underlying code.
Decorators are great for encapsulating code that is being reused often, which leads to cleaner and more pleasant to read code.


## Functions
In python, functions are first-class objects, which means that:

functions are objects (they can be referenced, passed to a variable, and returned)
functions can be defined inside another function
functions can also be passed as an argument to another function. Functions that take other functions as arguments are also called higher-order functions.

## Decorating Functions that have Arguments
We can make decorators work with functions that take an arbitrary number of parameters using function(*args, **kwargs) where *args are a tuple of positional arguments and **kwargs are a dictionary of keyword arguments.
```
def works_for_all(func):
    def inner(*args, **kwargs):
        print("I'm decorating something!")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return inner
 ```
## Identity crisis
An unintended consequence of decorating a function is that when we return it, it takes the identity of the inner function.
This can be confusing and sometimes even problematic if you need the function or class instance to retain its original properties.

```
from functools import wraps

def works_for_all(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def inner(*args, **kwargs):
        print("I'm decorating something!")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return inner
```
## Class decorators
We can also write decorators as classes. Most decorators can be written equivalently either as a function or a class,
so it is case-by-case. In general, class decorators are recommended if you want to maintain the state of an object.
